            "about": "To support our rendering pipeline I have implemented a frame graph, that defines how our frame is rendered and automates aspects of our pipeline. Throughout the development of the project, with feedback from other graphics programmers on the team, I have improved upon and implemented new features for the frame graph based on our needs.\n\n Currently available features are:\n **>** Automatic memory barrier placement\n **>** Reusing output resources across different render passes\n **>** Render pass sorting\n **>** Ability to write to different parts of the same resource at the same time across different render passes\n **>** Automatic viewport and scissor setup",

            "about": "Before any rendering happens, a compute shader dynamically creates a new ‘indirect’ index buffer to effectively merge geometry from unrelated meshes into a single indirect draw call. To make this possible I have contributed to our bindless resources setup. This means that instead of binding e.g. a diffuse, specular, ... textures before every draw call, the entire list of textures in the scene is bound at once and are accessed in the shaders using indices to the list.\n\n This technique is not only used for textures, but also materials. Which means that each instance of an object holds a material index that you can access your material with, and in turn the material holds indices for the textures of the instance inside the bindless textures list.",

By first down-sampling the bloom image and then up-sampling it while applying a 3x3 filter kernel, I have achieved a blurred bloom image, which resembles normal guassian blurring and runs faster compared to it.",

This is because we have multiple different configurations we want to package (linux/windows distribution, linux/windows development etc.) and all of our assets are stored on Perforce, because the GitHub LFS space given to our project was not enough to satisfy our needs. To solve the first issue I have implemented a JSON file workflow for build configurations where it's specified what files need to be packaged. As for getting our assets from Perforce, I have written scripts that automatically pull all of our assets into the GitHub Action to be packaged.",
