    "about": "At 16, I discovered Unity Engine and quickly fell in love with developing tools that streamlined workflows and improved the development environment. As I honed my skills, I secured two internships and a summer job, where I built tools used daily—gaining invaluable experience along the way.\n\n Initially, I planned to focus on tools development when I began my studies at Breda University of Applied Sciences. However, I soon discovered my second love: graphics programming. From my first months in the Creative Media and Game Technologies program, I was drawn to its complexity and challenges, diving in headfirst with my limited experience.\n\n Now, three years into my studies, I’ve developed exciting graphics features, including clustered shading for optimizing tens of thousands of lights, a frame graph for automating rendering processes (essentially a tool for graphics programming!) and more. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my expertise and grow as a programmer. And to do so, I am looking for an internship starting September 2025.\n\n P.S. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things, reading books and playing video games.",
